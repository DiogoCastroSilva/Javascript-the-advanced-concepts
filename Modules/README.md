# Modules

The Module Pattern is one of the most common design patterns used in JavaScript and for good reason.
The module pattern is easy to use and creates encapsulation of our code. Modules are commonly used as singleton style objects where only one instance exists. The Module Pattern is great for services and testing/TDD.
