# Functional Programming

Functional programming distinguishes between pure and impure functions. It encourages you to write pure functions. Its all about separation of concerns. A pure function must satisfy both of the following properties:

    * Referential transparency: The function always gives the same return value for the same arguments. This means that the function cannot depend on any mutable state.
    * Side-effect free: The function cannot cause any side effects. Side effects may include I/O (e.g., writing to the console or a log file), modifying a mutable object, reassigning a variable, etc.
